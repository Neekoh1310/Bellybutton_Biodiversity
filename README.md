# Bellybutton_Bioiversity

## Project Overview
In this project, I was tasked to create a website that displays the results of a scientific research involving belly button bacteria. The website will have interactive charts and graphs corresponding to the different test subjects and their bacteria. Ultimately, the goal is to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Resources
